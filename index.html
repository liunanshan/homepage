<h2><center> The 12th international workshop on SOFL + MSVL for Reliability and Security</center></h2>
<h3 style="font-weight:normal"><center>An <a href="https://formal-analysis.com/icfem/2023/">ICFEM 2023</a> satellite workshop, Brisbane, Australia, 21 November 2023</center>
</h3> 
		 
<p>
SOFL+MSVL is an annual workshop on formal engineering methods in relation to the SOFL method and the MSVL method. 
SOFL stands for Structured Object-Oriented Formal Language and SOFL method is a representative formal engineering method. 
MSVL stands for Modelling, Specification, and Verification Language that supports temporary logic-based modeling and specification as well as model checking for verification. 
This workshop is always organized as a satellite event of International Conference on Formal Engineering Methods (ICFEM).
SOFL+MSVL 2023 is the 12th workshop in the workshop series.中文

<h3 style="color:DarkBlue">Background and Objectives:</h3>
<p>
There is a growing interest in applying formal methods in practice to improve software reliability and security, but only with a few exceptions, this interest has not been successfully converted into the reality. How to enable practitioners to use formal techniques easily and effectively still remains challenging.  
The Structured Object-Oriented Formal Language (SOFL) has been developed to address this challenge by providing a comprehensible specification language, a practical modeling method, various verification and validation techniques, and tool support through effective integration of formal methods with conventional software engineering techniques. The Modeling, Simulation and Verification Language (MSVL) is a parallel programming language, and its supporting toolkit MSV has been developed to enable us to model, simulate and verify a system in a formal manner. <br> 
This workshop aims to continuously promote the development and combinations of the SOFL formal engineering method and the formal method MSVL, as well as the applications of their fundamental principles or specific techniques to developing other formal engineering techniques. We expect to bring industrial, academic and government experts of SOFL and MSVL to communicate and to exchange ideas. Researchers, practitioners, tool developers and users, and technology transfer experts are all welcome. The scope of the interest includes, but not limited to, all the possible issues in relation to SOFL, MSVL, or their applications in both developing other formal engineering techniques and specific software systems.
